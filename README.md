# Flux-Sort
A sort I came up with on the spot, not sure if any good or already exists, just want to develop it.

I Came up with it during a period of just trying to make a sorting algorithm from the top of my head, no idea what it's useful for/ if it useful/if it exists already but I really want to develop and optimise it as well as find the best test cases it works for.

I believe it will be most useful/effecient when dealing with a list that has a large spread of values.
